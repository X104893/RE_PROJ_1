Project Title
The purpose of this program is to help investor to choose correct timing to purchase homes.  The goal is to show  the best time to buy or sell real estate based on FEDâ€™S decision to raise or lower interest even though knowing what the FED will do is a bit difficult to know it can be predicted based on history.

Technologies
The code is written in Python 3.7. We imported the following: csv sys fire questionary. We also used a API key for FRED(not provided in this repo) you will need to request your api from Fred(https://fred.stlouisfed.org/docs/api/api_key.html)
